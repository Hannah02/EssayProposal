## Title: Out of Sight, Out of Mind? An Uncensored Look at the Digital Civil War in China.


## Research Question: In the face of a government that utilizes digital censorship and suppression of technology to control the behavior of it's population, how are Chinese citizens fighting back?


## Introduction

<!-- 98 words -->

There is a silent civil war being waged in China.
Conflicts for free speech are played out on a near daily basis, with China's ruling Communist Party restricting the same free speech that their constitution is supposed to guarantee. How are the citizens of this authoritarian country breaking the digital barriers imposed on their human rights? 

Civilians fight a quiet daily battle against government censorship using available technology in new and brilliant ways, as well as getting ahead of the censors by utilizing cutting edge technology. Is this a successful method? What can we expect in the future?


## Section 1: REDACTED

> “A revolution doesn’t happen when society adopts new tools. It happens when society adopts new behaviors.” 
*-Clay Shirky, "Here Comes Everybody: The Power of Organizing Without Organizations"*

<!-- 300 words (excluding quote) -->

In my mind, no one's free speech should be restricted by their government, especially when that same government has previously promised to garentee this basic human right. In modern day China, however, this Orwellian dystopia of restricted free speech is a daily reality for the country's citizens.

I want to set the scene by talking about how social media can be used to assemble an uprising against governments that subjugate their citizens, using Shirky's analysis of the Arab Spring as an example. I think that this shows how China's current regime of censorship and digital subterfuge prevent such an uprising for the cause of democracy from ever materializing, even though it is desperately desired by those whose human rights are being obstructed. 

I think that Charter 08 is a great example of how a group of activists have used international, uncensored social media to peacefully draw attention to the abuses of power the Chinese government have perpetrated against their people. The author of the charter, Liu Xiaobo, got the world talking about Charter 08 and this injustice on their own social media outlets such as Twitter and Facebook, which were not under the control of the Chinese government. I would also like to touch upon how this debate was reignited on international social media when Xiaobo died in 2017.

I will also dive into the more mundane ways that the general public use to fly under the radar of the Chinese government, such as using images, metaphors and codewords on Chinese social networking sites to criticize the current regime in a way that is less easy to detect. It is not that social media is new, but that people are using it in new and ever-evolving ways, which I think is an incredibly clever way to beat the system.


## Section 2: Social Exile

> "I started saying what I wanted, when I wanted. Just drop it out there. People don't always like that. It is incredible how fast you slip off the ladder when you start doing that."
*- Susan Taylor, "Black Mirror" Nosedive (2016)* 

<!-- 225 words (excluding quote) -->

The second section opens by using the Nosedive episode of "Black Mirror" as a way to introduce the Social Credit system in China. Much like the protagonist of the "Black Mirror" episode, Lacie, the people of China are finding themselves in a position where speaking about certain subjects or hanging around with perceived undesirables can have a negative effect on your social score. 

China's system is not dependent on peer-to-peer scores, but scores given by the Chinese government, which I feel makes the reality more sinister than the "Black Mirror" scenario.

Currently, citizens can be banned from traveling, refused admission to private schools and denied certain jobs if their score is too low. There have even been reports that criticizing the ruling party and a person's internet habits can lower an individual's score.

Additionally, this social credit score can also be entered in some Chinese dating websites as an added incentive for potential partners. One could make the argument that, as these seemingly trivial scores are given added importance within the social sphere, China moves towards creating a social taboo out of rebellion and effectively trying to breed out disobedience from the population. I think that this is an entirely unethical attempt at censoring views by rewarding those who are complicit with the current regime and punishing those who try to resist it.

## Section 3: Technology (r)evolution

<!-- 376 words. -->

Based on how both the Chinese government and general public have previously used the technology available to them, I feel that it is possible to sense how technologies that are inching ever closer into the mainstream will be used in China going forward. 

I want to highlight the work of 4Gentlemen who, in 2011, used augmented reality to stage a protest in Tiananmen Square. This protest featured 3D models of Tank Man and the Goddess of Democracy statue which were only visible in specific locations with the use of AR. I would like to touch upon how these protesters were early adapters of AR technology, which is important for them to be faster than any potential legislation against the technologies they wish to use.

I will talk about how technologies, using Augmented Reality as my main example, can be used on both sides of this battle. For example, IBM have recently been granted a patent for a technology to censor Augmented Reality. It is not unlikely, given IBM's longstanding relationship with China, that the Chinese government could adopt this technology to aid them in their work containing an uprising through the use of censorship. If this technology was utilized by the Chinese government, such protests as the 4Gentlemen AR protest would now be completely impossible.

In my opinion this game of cat-and-mouse between the government and the population will continue on until the Chinese people find a way to overthrow the government. As technology progresses, the Chinese people are presented with new ways to rebel against the current state of their country and make their voices heard.

The Arkangel episode of "Black Mirror" is a good example of how censorship can directly affect us. In this episode, a mother allows a surveillance and censorship device to be implanted into her daughter, Sara, in the hopes that she grows up happy and content. By the end of the episode, Sara has attacked her mother, broken the surveillance screen that her mother has been using and has ran away.
I feel like this is a good analogy of the current state of Chinese politics and how I feel that Chinese citizens now have an opportunity to rise up and change their country for the better. 

### Conclusion

<!-- 96 words. -->

My prediction is that, much like the character Sara in the Arkangel episode of Black Mirror, the Chinese people will eventually, through the use of technology available to them, find a successful way to rise up against their oppressive government and take power into their own hands.

While China's current regime places many obstacles between the people of China and the possibility of a democratic government, China will continue to have a digital resistance until the will of the people is realized. 

As technology evolves, so to do the possibilities for a new and innovative revolution.

Critical Bibliography
---------------------

+ [Shirky, C. (2014). Here comes everybody. New York: Penguin Books.](###)

In "Here comes everybody...", Shirky talks about how we organize and unite with others in the digital world. His analysis of how social media contributed to the Arab Spring uprising works well in my essay as a contrast to what is happening in China right now.  

After reading Shirky's book, we can see how powerful a tool social media can be for citizens to unite, making it clear that China's attempt to contain it's citizens through social media censorship prevents any similar major uprising from occurring. From Shirky's commentary on social media as a tool for igniting activism, I can make the argument that the lack of access to an uncensored public forum forces people to find other ways to band together.

"Charter 08" calls for the government to extend further human rights to Chinese citizens through a movement towards a democratic model for government, and freedom of speech (which is already supposed to be guaranteed in China, if you look at their constitution.) The manifesto's author, Liu Xiaobo, was jailed for 11 years (and died in custody in 2017) as a result of the charter's publication. News of Xiaobo winning the Nobel Peace Prize for his work was stifled in China. 

I felt like this manifesto, subsequent reporting about it's impact and the repercussions for it's author highlight that the people of China are willing to risk imprisonment to stand up for their rights with regards to free, unimpeded speech. In the absence of unrestricted social media in China, the manifesto's author and 303 initial signatories were still able to band together to take action which made global headlines. As a result, they opened up the debate about the human rights violations by the Chinese government to countries where the opinions against China are not regulated online. I will use this example to argue that Chinese social activism has found a way to utilize the unrestricted media of other countries in the absence of it's own in order to fight back against the oppressive communist government.

This article looks at a lot of the censorship practices in China, but for my dissertation I am mostly interested in the section towards the end titled "Circumventing the Censors". This gives an overview of some of the methods used by the Chinese public to circumvent online censors and access information. 

It is important as it shows the ways in which the Chinese general public use small but significant ways to communicate about the current regime in spite of government censors.

+ [Nosedive: Black Mirror, 2016, television program, Netflix, 21 October 2016](###)

China's 'Social Credit System' has often been compared to this shocking episode of Black Mirror, where social media ratings dictate every aspect of life from what houses you can buy to where you can work. Although the 'Social Credit System' is still in development and features scores from the government as opposed to fellow citizens, the possibility for it to live up to the dystopian future of Black Mirror's Nosedive episode is very real.

Here, the government have put into place a system that further incentives the Chinese population to comply with the censorship system in order to maintain the status quo for the benefit of the government. It shows that human rights and the welfare of the Chinese people are not the governments first concern.

This article looks in more detail at the intricacies of the Social credit system. It also pics up on the fact that the credit score of your friends has a direct impact on your social credit score, and as a result, dissidents will be sent into, what Falkvinge calls, "social exile".

I want to assert that, in this case, technology is being used to create an air of accountability and suspicion between citizens in order to uphold the censorship and control that the Chinese government thrives upon.

This article talks about how AR allows us to have a space that can have one function in reality, and another hidden use that we can unlock through AR. It goes into the 4Gentlemen protest in Tiananmen Square and how the use of AR was significant in staging this protest. I want to show how early adaption of emerging technologies is key for people in China to have their voices heard.

This shows IBM's patent for a device that can censor a video recording of an environment, more specifically for AR and VR headsets. Given IBM's historic partnership with China and Chinese companies, this takes my research question into the future technology and how cutting edge innovations could potentially be utilized by the Chinese government to quash protests using AR or VR, like those conducted by 4Gentlemen.


+ [Arkangel: Black Mirror, 2017, television program, Netflix, 29 December 2017](###)

In this episode of Black Mirror touches on augmented reality censorship and it's effects on the individual. I find that the themes of surveillance and censorship make what the main character, Sara, is being subjected to a good metaphor for what the people of China are being subjected to.
